**Calendar for events (parties)**

*Stepanov Egor*

I am planning to create a web application that will function as a calendar
	for events for students. As a student I am planning to use it myself. 
	I am living at the dormitory and I would like to know about all 
	the parties that are planned here in the near future and also 
	who are attending them. The idea is to create a calendar where anyone can 
	create an event (more likely a party) with the description when and where 
	exactly event will take place. Anyone can plan to attend a party in the calendar.
	Every user sees who and which event is everyone attending.

Functionality of web application:

*  creation/removal of an event 
*  joining or leaving an event
*  rating and commenting of events
*  inviting users to an event
*  making a friend list (all events that your friends are attending will be highlighted for you)
